## High Level Design
Built in C++ with the following open source libraries:
1. Networking implemented with zyre ( https://github.com/zeromq/zyre )
2. Messaging between players implemented with protobuf ( https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf )
3. GUI implemented with raylib and raygui ( https://github.com/raysan5/raylib and https://github.com/raysan5/raygui )

## Supported Platforms
All over these libraries are cross platform and should run on x86, ARM, macOS and Windows.</br>
At this point, only working on x86.
